***Mail Room - Functional Programming Version***

Goal:
Make Mailroom 'Functional' (or at least add a few functional features)

A New Approach

It was reasonable to build the simple Mailroom program using a single module, a simple data structure, and functions that manipulate that data structure. It was reasonable to refactor Mailroom around classes when it started to become unwieldy with all of the features we wanted to add to it.
Due to the success of Mailroom and the good PR it has generated with all its thank you letters, the donations are pouring in. This has raised the attention of wealthy philanthropists who are willing to contribute matching funds. Our problem now is to expand Mailroom so that it can run projections and account for matching funds offered by philanthropists. Management is tremendously happy with us and has offered to support our expansion of Mailroom toward a distributed architecture capable of running calculations on matching funds across the donor database in parallel.

This is a good candidate for a functional programming approach.


Map, Filter, Reduce

Add a new feature to Mailroom using map so that each donation on record can be doubled, tripled or indeed multiplied by any arbitrary factor based on the whims of philanthropists who would like to support our cause.
This will require a new function (or method in your donor database class) called challenge(factor) that takes a multiplier (factor), and multiplies all the donations of all the donors by the factor. The function returns a NEW donor database, with the new data.
Add a new feature to Mailroom using filter so that donations either above or below a specified dollar amount are included in the map operations of #1 above.
You can do this by adding min_donation and max_donation optional keyword parameters to your challenge function. Youâ€™ll want to filter the donations before passing them to map.
Refactor the new features outlined in #1 and #2 above such that they can be used to run projections. Imagine the following scenario. You are an account manager out in the field meeting with philanthropists and talking with them about the many ways they might structure their matching contributions. You would like a feature that could show them, based on past contributions, what their total contribution would become under different scenarios. For instance, based on donations in the current database, show them (a) what their total contribution would come to in dollars if they were to double contributions under $100. And then (b) show them what their total contribution would come to if they were to triple contributions over $50.
This may require another option in your menu-driven interface.
Use map, filter, and either sum or reduce to accomplish the goals above
