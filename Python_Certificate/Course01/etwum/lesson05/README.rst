***Except Exercise***

Run except_exercise.py:
$ python except_exercise.py
(or run except_exercise.py in iPython)
You will find that it crashes with an exception.
Your job is to write the proper exception handler so that the code can run.
It will then crash again.
You will then need to handle the next exception.

***Mail Room Part 3***

Add exceptions and use comprehensions to improve your mailroom project.

Exceptions
Now that you’ve learned about exception handling, you can update your code to handle errors better – like when a user inputs bad data.

Comprehensions
Can you use comprehensions to clean up your code a bit?
